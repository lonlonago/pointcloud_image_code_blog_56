  ```  
    Use one or more of the above syntax's Name, Value pair parameters to specify additional options for writing to STL files. For example, stlwrite (TR, 'stlbinary', 'Attribute', attributes) also writes a uint16 attribute vector for each triangle in the TR.

#  III. Parameter analysis 

##  1. Input parameters 

##  2. Name-value parameters 

 示例： stlwrite(TR,'stltext','SolidIndex',solidIDs) 

    Specify an optional, comma-separated Name, Value pair group parameter. Name is the parameter name and Value is the corresponding value. Name must be enclosed in single quotes (’ ') . You can specify name-value pair group parameters in any order, such as Name1, Value1, Name2, Value2. 

#  IV. Remarks 

    This function was introduced in Matlab R2018b.
