#  Function overview 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The function determines the visible point in the point cloud from the specified viewpoint using the following steps. 1. Associates the point cloud with the coordinate system centered at the viewpoint. 2. Performs inversion using a spherical projection. 

 3. Calculate the convex hull of the transformed point cloud and viewpoint, and the point inside the convex hull is the visible point.
