#  Function overview 

##  1. Implement the algorithm 

   In the Matlab point cloud toolbox, there is a direct implementation of the RANSAC fitting plane algorithm, without having to write fancy implementation code yourself (it seems like you are so powerful). 

##  2. Main functions

  ```  
 Fit a point cloud with the maximum allowable distance from an independent point to the plane. The function returns a geometric model describing the plane. The function uses the M-Estimator Sample Consistency (MSAC) algorithm to find the plane. The MSAC algorithm is a variant of the Random Sample Consistency (RANSAC) algorithm.

  ```  
 The direction constraint is added when fitting the plane, and the direction vector is an additional direction constraint specified by the 1 × 3 vector input.
