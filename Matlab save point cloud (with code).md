#  III. Parameter analysis 

##  input parameter 

#  Point cloud storage objects 

   pointCloud objects create point cloud data from a set of points in a 3D coordinate system. These points typically represent the and geometric coordinates of a sample surface or environment. Each point can also be represented with additional information, such as RGB color. Point cloud data is stored as an object with properties listed in properties. Use object functions to retrieve, select, and delete the desired points from the point cloud data.

  ```  
   Create a pointCloud object whose properties are specified as one or more name, value, and parameter pairs. For example, pointCloud (xyzPoints, 'Color', [0 0 0]) sets the color property of point xyzPoints to [0 0 0]. Enclose each property name in quotes. Any property that is not specified has a default value.
