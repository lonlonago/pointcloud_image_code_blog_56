#  Function overview 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The spherical rotation method triangulates a set of points by rolling a sphere of radius over a cloud of points. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

#  Fourth, a warning!!! 

   Copy and paste the code to run directly, and do not read other content of the blog. If you report an error, you will directly open "Why did I report an error, what kind of garbage code is this"??? pc2surfacemesh is a new function in matlab2022b and above, so why do some bosses make mistakes?? Why ask?????
