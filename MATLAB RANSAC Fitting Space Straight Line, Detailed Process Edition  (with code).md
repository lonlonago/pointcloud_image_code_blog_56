#  I. Overview of algorithms 

##  1. Implementation process 

 1. First, a small number of points are randomly selected from the point cloud, which will be used to fit the line. 

 2. Compute a model of a straight line passing through these points and use that model to calculate the distance from all points in the point cloud to that line. 

 3. Set a distance threshold and define all points in the point cloud that are less than the distance from the straight line as interior points. 

 4. If the number of interior points is greater than a certain threshold (e.g. 50%), use all interior points to refit the straight line model; otherwise, return to step 1. 

 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or the stop condition is satisfied. 

 6. The resulting straight line model is what is required. 

##  2. Parameter analysis 

>  A, b, c represent the coordinates of a point on the line, d, e, f represent the direction vector of the line.
